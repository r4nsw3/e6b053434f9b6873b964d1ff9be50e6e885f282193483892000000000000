  |   Choose your own route around the world, travelling by airship,        |
  |   submarine, mechanical camel, steam-train and more, racing other       |
  |   players and a clock that never stops in TIME Magazine's #1 Game of    |
  |   the Year 2014, now on Switch.                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Featuring stunning art by Jaume Illustration, a half-million word     |
  |   script by Meg Jayanth and Jon Ingold, original music by Laurence      |
  |   Chapman, 80 DAYS is an interactive adventure created by your          |
  |   choices, on the fly, and is different every time you play.            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Playing as Phileas Fogg's loyal valet, Passepartout, you must         |
  |   balance your master's health, your finances, and the time, as you     |
  |   choose your own path from city to city all the way around the         |
  |   world. Bribe your way onto early departures, but don't let yourself   |
  |   go bankrupt or you'll be sleeping rough and begging for aid! Trade    |
  |   items for profit, and collect the equipment for the conditions        |
  |   you'll face: but too much luggage will slow you down...               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   80 DAYS is a breakneck race, with an in-game clock that never stops   |
  |   running. Trains, steamers, hot-air balloons, boats, camels, horses    |
  |   and more leave and arrive minute by minute.                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Every city and journey is narrated via an interactive story where     |
  |   you control every action. Will your choices speed you up - or lead    |
  |   you into disaster? Will you earn Fogg's trust and respect? Will you   |
  |   uncover the secrets and short-cuts that can shave days off your       |
  |   time? Murder, romance, rebellion and intrigue await!                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   150 cities to explore. Millions of journeys. Detailed research and    |
  |   techno-fantasy combine in an 1872 of tensions, inventions and         |
  |   exploration. Climb the Burmese mountains, trek the Zulu Federation,   |
  |   sail up the Amazon and disappear under the Indian Ocean - but don't   |
  |   fall behind the time!                                                 |
